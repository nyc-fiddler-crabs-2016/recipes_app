formerly of the _flash partial.

<%= flash[:notice].join("<br>") if flash[:notice] %>
<%= flash[:alert].join("<br>") if flash[:alert] %>
<%= flash[:now].join("<br>") if flash[:now] %>


which worked fine for the UserRecipes controller create and  actions but breaks in the recipes controller create action. damned if I get why?

#recipes_controller
#I don't get why this is an issue but the same type of syntax in the userrecipe controller works fine. '''<%= flash[:alert].join("<br>") if flash[:alert] %>'''| '''undefined method `join' for "Recipe Added":String'''

then again - I just replaced those three silly if statements above with the exact three measly lines of code in the rails guide and lo and behold it works excellently so far.

so Iam confused as to how it could be easier, as a mentor told me there was an even easier way which I should google.? could it get easier than those three tiny lines which rails guide spells out explicitly for us already? time will tell.
